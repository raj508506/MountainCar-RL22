# MountainCar-RL22
This project applies Reinforcement Learning, specifically Q-learning, to solve the Mountain Car environment from OpenAI Gym. The goal is for the car to learn how to reach the top of a hill by gaining momentum through trial and error. It demonstrates how RL can tackle control problems by maximizing cumulative rewards over time.
